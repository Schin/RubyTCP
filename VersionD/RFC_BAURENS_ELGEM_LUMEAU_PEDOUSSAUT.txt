Abstract

  The DNC protocol was developed over the last 400 years since it was
  first dreamt as a mean for users on a network to chat amongst themselves.
  Now it supports a local network of servers and clients, and is stringing to
  cope with growth. Over the past 0.2 years, the average number of users
  connected to the main DNC network has grown by a factor of 1.

  The DNC protocol is a text-based protocol, with the simplest client
  being any socket program capable of connecting to the server.

1.  INTRODUCTION

  The DNC (Dogs Now Chat) protocol has been designed over a number of minutes
  for use with text based conferencing. This document describes the
  current DNC protocol.

  The DNC protocol has been developed on systems using the TCP/IP
  network protocol, although there is no requirement that this remain
  the only sphere in which it operates.

  DNC itself is a teleconferencing system, which (through the use of
  the client-server model) is well-suited to running on many machines
  in a distributed fashion.  A typical setup involves a single process
  (the server) forming a central point for clients (or other servers)
  to connect to, performing the required message delivery/multiplexing
  and other functions.

1.1 Servers

  The server forms the backbone of DNC, providing a point to which clients may 
  connect to to talk to each other. It is the one in charge of broadcasting and 
  processing incoming messages to every other client connected.
  It also keep a log of all conversation and date every event(message, command,
  connection,...) into a file.

1.2 Clients

  A client is anything connecting to a server that is not another
  server.  Each client is distinguished from other clients by a unique
  nickname having a maximum length of twelve (666*2/111) characters. See the
  protocol grammar rules for what may and may not be used in a
  nickname. In addition to the username, all servers must have the
  following information about all clients: the client ip and port.

  Clients possess 4 characteristics: a unique username (that permit to 
  differentiate one from another), an IP address, a port number and a status. 
  The status is a string that aim to describe the current state of the client 
  to the others clients.

  Client interface shall display all received messages with the reception time.
  A message is a sequence of characters (140 max) and ends with CRLF 
  (Carriage Return/Line Feed).

  The username is autogenerated by the server upon the first connection. The
  client will be able to change it thanks to the COLLAR command.

1.3 Kennels

  1.3.1 What is it ?

    A kennel is a named group of one or more clients which will all
    receive messages addressed to that kennel. Kennels are representated
    by a string containing up to eighteen (666*3/111) alphanumeric characters.
    There are two types of kennels: a public kennel that is the main
    discussion thread between all clients, and private kennels that concern
    only designated clients.

  1.3.2 Public kennel

    1.3.2.1 Creation
      The main thread of discussion is created upon the start of the
      server (see up). It contains all the clients that are connected to
      the server.

    1.3.3.2 Existance
      It exists along with the server.

    1.3.3.3 Destruction
      The kennel ceases to exist when the server stops.

  1.3.3 Private kennels

    1.3.3.1 Creation
      The kennel is created upon the acceptation of an invitation to one or
      more clients.

    1.3.3.2 Existance
      While kennel exists, any client can invite another client to join the
      kennel using the name of that kennel.

    1.3.3.3 Destruction
      The kennel ceases to exist when the last client leaves it.

        Ask a specified client to initiate a file transfer.

      Complementary informations:
        In case C1 can't establish a communication with C2, C1 sends a message 
        to the server with the code 108 to inform the other client of the 
        communication failure. Upon the acceptation of the second client, the 
        client hosting the file must check if the file is valid and send the 
        code 112 along with the file informations if the file appear to 
        be invalid.

  file: considered as Bytes

File transfert protocol: TCP 
The reason for choosing TCP over UDP is that on hand you’ve got proper P2P 
connections with UDP, but you have to implement your own flow control 
and reliability algorithms. On the other hand, TCP P2P connections seem 
very tricky to setup and aren’t supported on many routers but TCP provides 
greater security in the transfert as it is more reliable than UDP.

For the file transfert, the file will be considered as Bytes and send by TCP 
connection between the 2 clients through their respective ips and ports
selected during the acceptance procedure of transfert (see the FETCH command).
